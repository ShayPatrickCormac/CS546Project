Overview
     reserved6 is an unused former placeholder block.

Obtaining
    reserved6 cannot be obtained via /give or /setblock, and as such can only be obtained through inventory editors or other methods such as using behavior packs to change loot tables.

Usage
    From v0.3.3 to v0.6.1, reserved6 replaced any fire blocks created due to an issue where fire would spread throughout an entire world after a single flammable block had been set aflame by lava.
