Overview
    The stonecutter is an unused decorative block. It was previously used to craft many stone items in Bedrock Edition until those recipes were moved to the Crafting Table. It was later replaced by a new Stonecutter in the creative inventory, but it still exists in old worlds which had one.

Obtaining
    Stonecutters were available in the creative inventoryâ€Œ[New Nintendo 3DS Edition  only], by pick blocking an existing stonecutter in the world or by using third-party software.

  Breaking
    An old stonecutter required a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it dropped itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining was slower and it dropped nothing.
