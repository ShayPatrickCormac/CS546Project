Overview
    info_update and info_update2 are debugging/placeholder blocks exclusive to Bedrock Edition that generated in place of blocks that are not yet added.

Obtaining
    These blocks can no longer be obtained. They used to generate instead of magma blocks when a player with a lower version of the game where the block had not been added joined a player with a higher one.[more information needed]

Usage
    info_update blocks, even if obtained through a third-party software, cannot be placed.
info_update2 blocks can be placed and broken, and drop when broken with any tool.
