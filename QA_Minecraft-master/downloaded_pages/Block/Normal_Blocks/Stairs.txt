Overview
    Stairs are blocks that allow mobs and players to change elevation without jumping.

Obtaining
  Breaking
    Wood stairs drop themselves as items when broken with any tool, or with no tool, but an axe is fastest. Non-wood stairs drop themselves as items only if broken with a pickaxe. Compared to slabs, the hardness values (and thus, breaking time) of stairs better reflect the blocks they are made from.[1]

  Crafting
    Wood stairs must be crafted entirely from one type and color of wood, and they retain the style of that wood's type and color.

Usage
  Placement
    To place stairs, use a stairs item while pointing at a surface facing the space the stairs should occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the player. Stairs can be placed either right side up or upside-down: Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material): Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa.

  Walking
    Walking up stairs is faster than jumping up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn't cost any exhaustion from the player's hunger bar, compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all.

  Behavior
    Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.

  Fuel
    Overworld wooden stairs can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

  Note blocks
    Wooden stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds. Stone stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass drum" sounds.
