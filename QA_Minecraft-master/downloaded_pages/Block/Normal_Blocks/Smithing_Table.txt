Overview
    A smithing table is a utility block used to alter tools and armor at the cost of a smithing template and the appropriate material. This process keeps all enchantments of the altered item. This is the only way to obtain trimmed armor or upgrade diamond equipment with netherite. It also serves as a toolsmith's job site block.

Obtaining
    Smithing tables can be either found or crafted.

  Breaking
    Smithing tables can be broken using any tool or by hand, but an axe is the fastest.

Usage
  Smithing
    A smithing table is primarily used for upgrading diamond gear to netherite gear and for trimming armor. The smithing interface is accessed by pressing use on a smithing table. Each time working a smithing table, the player must provide a smithing template in the left-most slot, armor/tool in the central slot, and an augmenting material in the right-most slot. Working at smithing table costs no experience, and item data such as durability, enchantments, and custom names are preserved. Upgrading to netherite requires a netherite upgrade smithing template, a diamond tool or a piece of diamond armor, and a netherite ingot.

    Decorative trims can be applied to any piece of armor - including turtle shells - by using an armor trim smithing template and a trim material. After trimming, the armor will show a decorative pattern corresponding to the smithing template with the color determined by the used material. A preview of this pattern can be seen on an armor stand model, located on the right side of smithing table's GUI.

  Changing profession
    If a village contains a smithing table that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to toolsmith. If a villager with this profession has already been traded with, it cannot change jobs.

  Fuel
    Smithing tables can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.

  Note Blocks
    Smithing tables can be placed under note blocks to produce "bass" sounds.
