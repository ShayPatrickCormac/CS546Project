Overview
    Nether quartz ore is ore found in the Nether, and is a source of quartz.

Obtaining
  Breaking
    Nether quartz ore can be mined with any pickaxe, or it drops nothing. If mined with Silk Touch, the block drops itself. Otherwise, it drops 1 nether quartz (or more with Fortune). It also drops 2â€“5 when broken.

  Natural generation
    Nether quartz ore can generate in the Nether in the form of ore blobs. Nether quartz ore attempts to replace netherrack 16 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-24, from levels 10 to 117, in all Nether biomes. In Java Edition, in basalt deltas, nether quartz ore attempts to generate 32 times per chunk as there are fewer valid generation areas.
