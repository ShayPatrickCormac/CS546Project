Overview
    A torchflower  is a flower obtained from harvesting torchflower seeds. It can be crafted into orange dye.

Obtaining
    Torchflowers do not generate naturally, they are obtained by breaking a fully grown torchflower crop. In Bedrock Edition, unlike with other one-block-tall flowers, players cannot spread torchflowers on top of nearby grass blocks by applying bone meal on a torchflower.

  Breaking
    A torchflower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself. A torchflower also breaks if water or lava runs over its location, if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

  Mob loot
    Endermen can pick up torchflowers, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

Usage
    Like most flowers, torchflowers can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots. Torchflowers can also be placed in flower pots.

  Suspicious stew
    Using a torchflower to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Night Vision effect that lasts 8 seconds in Java Edition and 6 seconds in Bedrock Edition.

  Bees
    Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with torchflowers, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.

  Breeding
    Torchflowers can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.

  Bee nests
    Oak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of a torchflower have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.

  Composting
    Placing a torchflower into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
