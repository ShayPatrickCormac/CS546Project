Overview
    An endermite is the smallest hostile mob. An endermite may spawn when a player throws an ender pearl. They attack by biting the player. Endermen are hostile toward endermites.

Spawning
    Endermites have a 5% chance to spawn when a player-thrown ender pearl lands. They spawn at the player's original position when the pearl lands‌[Java Edition  only], or at the pearl's landing site‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. An endermite despawns within 2 minutes, regardless of the player's distance, except for when it has been named with a name tag.

Drops
    Endermites drop 3 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Behavior
    Endermites attack players within 16 blocks and become hostile toward any mob if it attacks an endermite. Endermen attack an endermite within 64 blocks. Endermites attack iron golems and endermen in Bedrock Edition. As arthropods, endermites are affected by the Bane of Arthropods enchantment.
