Overview
    A skeleton is an undead hostile mob that performs ranged attacks with a bow.

Spawning
  Under the darkness
    A skeleton may spawn above a solid block at a light level of 0 from all Overworld except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes, usually in small groups of up to four skeletons in Java Edition or two skeletons in Bedrock Edition. 80% of skeletons spawned directly under the sky in snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen oceans, deep frozen oceans and legacy frozen oceans biomes spawn as stray mobs.

  From spider jockeys
    Spiders have a very low chance to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey.

  From skeletal traps during thunderstorms
    Four skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton horse trap is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm. The skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets and, in Java Edition, have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.

  In the Nether
    Skeletons spawn commonly in soul sand valleys biomes. However, existing skeletons lower the spawning chances of other hostile mobs nearby, meaning there are much less skeletons in a given area compared to zombified piglins in nether wastes. In nether fortresses structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a wither skeleton.

  Monster spawners
    Skeletons spawn from 25% of the monster spawners found in monster rooms.

  Trial spawners
    ‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], regular skeletons or skeletons holding arrows of poison in their off-hand have a chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

Behavior
    Skeletons chase players, baby turtles and iron golems they see within 16 blocks, climbing stairs or ladders, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within shooting range. When within 15 blocks of a target, with a clear line of sight, a skeleton starts shooting with arrows, once every 2 seconds on Easy and Normal difficulties or once every second on Hard difficulty. If the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again. Their detection range is reduced by 50% if a skeleton skull is worn by the player. This stacks with sneaking and the Invisibility effect. The skeleton's accuracy is based on the world difficulty. Skeletons have an "error" of 10 on Easy, 6 on Normal and 2 on Hard. This is compared to the player's lack of accuracy of 1. To account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target. Skeletons have infinite durability on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows. Arrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground. Skeleton behavior varies between the game editions: Java Edition Bedrock Edition In most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton. When a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead. Skeletons flee from wolves. A skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it. Skeletons sink in water and cannot swim, but do not drown. If a skeleton is inside of powder snow for 7 seconds, it converts into a stray. A newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton. The converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton. Only skeletons can become strays; wither skeletons cannot be converted. If spawned with a weapon other than a bow or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as /summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:"iron_sword"}]}, or /summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {}), or it picks up a weapon other than a bow, a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton. A skeleton holding a tipped arrow in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed. If a creeper dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any music discs except for Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic.

  Sunlight
    Skeletons burn at dawn when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is: If not wearing a helmet, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself. Unlike zombies, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.

  Mob type
    Skeletons are undead mobs, causing them to be damaged by the Instant Health status effect, healed by the Instant Damage status effect, and unaffected by the status effects Regeneration and Poison. Skeletons are ignored by the wither and are affected by the Smite enchantment.

  Geared skeletons
    Some spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground. Unlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor. If a picked up item is armor, a carved pumpkin or a mob head, a skeleton equips itself with the item. If the picked up item is a weapon, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon. In Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot. Skeletons spawn already-armed with bows, which may be enchanted. The chances of that event are listed below from code. If a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.

    ,Easy,Normal,Hard
    Armor,0%,0%–15% [note 1],1.875%–15% [note 1]
    Weapon [note 2],100%,100%,100%
    Pick up,0%,0%–55% [note 1],6.875%–55% [note 1]

    Armor enchantment [note 3],0%,0%–50% [note 1],6.25%–50% [note 1]

    If a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:

    Armor,Easy & Normal,Hard
    1 piece,100%,100%
    2 pieces,75%,90%
    3 pieces,56.25%,81%
    Full set,42.19%,72.9%

    In Java Edition, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and in Bedrock Edition, they go from head to feet. The chances of it being of a particular material are:

    Armor Type,Chance
    Leather,37.06%
    Gold,48.73%
    Chain,12.90%
    Iron,1.2%
    Diamond,0.04%

    The armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like carved pumpkins) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its hitbox. If a skeleton has a bow and a sword is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I and starts using the sword. If a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one. Any skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1–3 extra experience points per item. If multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.[3] On Halloween, skeletons may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.
