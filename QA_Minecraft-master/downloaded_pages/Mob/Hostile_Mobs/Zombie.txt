Overview
    Zombies are common undead hostile mobs that deal melee damage and attack in groups.

Spawning
  Natural generation
    Zombies may spawn in the Overworld in groups of up to four above solid blocks at a light level of 0, except in mushroom fields and deep dark biomes. All zombie variants (including babies) require a 2-block tall space to spawn. All zombies spawned in desert biomes and exposed to the sky have a likelihood of 80%‌[JE  only]/70%‌[BE  only] to be replaced by husks. Zombies that are not husks or drowned have a 5% chance to spawn as zombie villagers. Zombie variants have a 5% chance to spawn as babies.The baby zombies also have a chance of spawning as a chicken jockey in Java Edition. Zombies spawn with up to 5% of knockback resistance. When a zombie spawn egg is used on a zombie, it spawns a baby zombie.

  Sieges
    If a player is near a village at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned in the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. The spawning can even happen in mushroom fields biome if the triggering player is in an adjacent biome. Zombies spawned as a part of a siege are always regular zombies; zombie villagers, husks and drowned never spawn as a part of a siege, even in their respective biomes.

  Monster spawners
    Inside monster rooms, zombies may have a chance to spawn from a monster spawner. Zombies spawned from a monster spawner are never zombie villagers in Java Edition, although zombie monster spawners in Bedrock Edition are able to produce them. Zombies spawn from monster spawners inside 50% of monster rooms.

  Trial spawners
    ‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], adult zombies have a chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers; baby zombies have a chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for trial spawners.

  Husks
    When a husk's head is submerged in water for over 30 seconds, the husk starts transforming into a zombie, with a new entity UUID. The husk's equipment remains on the zombie after conversion.‌[JE  only] The zombie transforms into a drowned if its head remains submerged.

Variants
  Baby zombies
    Baby zombies make up 5% of zombie spawns. They behave similarly to regular zombies, with the following differences: In Bedrock Edition, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombies can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking. The jockey mobs ridden by the baby zombie adapt the speed of its rider. In Bedrock Edition, a baby zombie can ride:

  Zombie villagers
    Zombie villagers have a 5% chance of spawning in place of zombies and may also spawn from a villager killed by a zombie. The chance of a villager turning into a zombie villager when killed by a zombie or zombie variant depends on the difficulty level. When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers‌‌[Bedrock Edition  only], or a single zombie villager.‌‌[Java Edition  only] If any type of zombie kills a villager, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

    Normal,50%
    Hard,100%

    Any villagers that get killed by a zombie have a chance to turn into a zombie villager with armor on normal or hard difficulties. Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the Weakness effect, which can be applied by: The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) golden apple on them.

  Husks
    Husks have an 80% chance to spawn in desert biomes in place of zombies. They attack like regular zombies, but inflict hunger for several seconds and do not burn in sunlight.

  Drowned
    Drowned mobs spawn in ocean ruins, rivers, most parts of oceans or when a normal zombie drowns. They are able to swim and breathe underwater as well as walk on land. Most drowned use melee attacks, but some spawn with tridents and throw them when attacking instead. Zombies that are wearing armor and go underwater continue wearing the armor when converted to a drowned, although tools and weapons are lost.‌[JE  only] Zombies that convert to drowned drop all worn or held equipment with full durability and preserving existing enchantments.‌[BE  only]

  Geared zombies
    On Halloween, zombies may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern‌[Java Edition  only]. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting. Some zombies spawn wearing armor or holding tools, both of which may be enchanted. In addition, zombies may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. Zombie villagers can also spawn naturally with armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Zombies cannot naturally spawn with netherite armor.

    Armor worn by zombies is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombies can eventually wear away and break if the zombie is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombies also have a natural armor rating of 2 (), giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from most sources. Zombies can also wear mob heads, although they need to be dropped by the player before the zombie can pick one up and put it on.

  Taken equipment
    Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

  Naturally-spawned equipment
    Zombies have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:

  Experience
    Any zombie that spawns with equipment gives 1–3 extra experience points per item when killed. Adult zombies drop 5 and baby zombies drop 12 when they are killed by a player or a tamed wolf.

Behavior
  Attacking the player
    Zombies pursue the player on sight from 35 blocks away in Java Edition or 16 blocks away in Bedrock Edition, raising their arms up.‌[JE  only] The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie head. If a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first. A zombie already chasing a villager continues to do so even if the player is near, until the player attacks it.
Zombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away. Zombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall damage, fire, lava, magma blocks, and cactus and try to find the shortest path toward the player.[1] Unlike skeletons, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.

  Attacking turtles
    Zombies attack baby turtles and actively seek out and destroy turtle eggs within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.

  Attacking utility mobs
    Zombies pursue and attack golem utility mobs within 42 blocks. Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.

  Attacking villagers
    Zombies target villagers within a 35– to 52.5–block radius (depending on regional difficulty)‌[Java Edition  only] or a 16-block radius‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and they can always see villagers through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it‌[JE  only]. Once a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the player, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked‌[JE  only]. Any zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the difficulty:

  Attacking wandering traders
    Zombies target wandering traders within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the invisibility status effect.

  Burning under daylight
    When the sun is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight. Burning is suppressed when the zombie is: Transparent and translucent blocks, including glass and ice, do not prevent them from burning.‌[JE  only]. If they attack an entity while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30×regional difficulty)% chance and with a 2×floor (regional difficulty) second duration. If wearing armor enchanted with Thorns while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.

  Undead
    Zombies are undead mobs, harmed by the status effect Healing, healed by the status effect Instant Damage and are unaffected by Regeneration and Poison. The wither does not attack zombies. Zombies are affected by the Smite enchantment.

  Picking up items
    Some zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across. Mob heads and carved pumpkins are automatically worn on their heads. Zombies can equip armor, weapons or tools. If a zombie encounters another similar item, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if: Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by hoppers. A zombie holding a picked-up item does not despawn when left alone, similar to being name tagged. Zombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard difficulty. Picked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.

  Breaking doors
    Up to 10% of zombies (depending on regional difficulty) in pursuit of a target bang on closed wooden doors and on Hard (and Hardcore) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down. Otherwise, the door cracks but does not break. The zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way. Zombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.

  Reinforcements
    On all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even zombified piglins[3]) call all other zombies within a 67×21×67 to 111×21×111 area[n 1] centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker. In Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to "help" when damaged. Each zombie has a "likeliness to call reinforcements" statistic ranging from 0–10%, and "leader" zombies (0–5% depending on regional difficulty) get a bonus of 50–75 percentage points to the stat. When the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or ±7–40 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement. Both the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their "likeliness to call reinforcement" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way.  Zombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like mushroom fields, the End, and the Nether[4], although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed. These effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely. That is, if the zombified mob drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements. Additionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the game rule doMobSpawning is set to false. Leader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements. The chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning. Reinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the hostile mob cap. They also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.[5] Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.

  Becoming drowned
    If a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a drowned. The zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned. Once this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water. This time is not affected by the Respiration enchantment or the Water Breathing status effect. A newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie. An item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability‌[BE  only]. Only normal zombies can become drowned; zombie villagers and zombified piglins cannot be converted.[6] Husks, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a drowned as does a normal zombie. Any husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.
