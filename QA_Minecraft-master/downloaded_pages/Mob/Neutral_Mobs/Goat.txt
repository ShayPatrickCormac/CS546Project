Overview
    A goat is a neutral mob found in certain mountainous biomes. Goats can jump especially high and ram mobs. They are a source of goat horns and milk.

Spawning
    Groups of two to three goats spawn above stone variants of opaque blocks on snowy slopes, jagged peaks, and frozen peaks at the surface at a light level of 7 or higher. Goats spawn individually and more uncommonly after the world generation. 5% of all goats spawn as babies. When a goat is spawned naturally or through breeding normal goats, it has a 2% chance of being a screaming‌[JE  only]/screamer‌[BE  only] goat. They look identical to all other goats, but they make screaming sounds and ram more often.

Drops
    Adult goats drop 1–3 when killed by a player or tamed wolf, while 1–7 is dropped upon successful breeding. Killing a baby goat yields no items or experience.

  Goat horns
    Goats drop a goat horn when they charge into a solid block. These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, logs, and packed ice. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified using a data pack. There are 4 horn variants for normal goats ("Ponder", "Sing", "Seek", and "Feel"), and 4 horn variants that only screaming goats drop ("Admire", "Call", "Yearn", and "Dream"). Goats do not regrow their horns; therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat.

Behavior
    When left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands. Their behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs. Goats take 10 less fall damage and avoid walking into powder snow. Goats do not get hurt by pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and don't die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.

  Jumping
    A goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or powder snow. It lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally. Once a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds. A goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a piston. Standing on a honey block prevents a goat from jumping.

  Ramming
    Every 30 to 300 seconds, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4–16 blocks. They can target players, armor stands, or any mob except for ghasts and other goats. A charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target. If the charge connects, it deals 1 to 3 damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of knockback to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall. This attack is not affected by Thorns.[1] As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first. If a goat rams a solid block that occurs naturally in its environment, it can drop one of its two goat horns. Mobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for piglins, piglin brutes, hoglins, zoglins, and wardens.[2] Goats don't target players in Creative mode or any players in Peaceful difficulty. Unlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it, and it does not call for backup if harmed. Baby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks. A screaming goat's ramming cooldown is 5 to 15 seconds.[more information needed]

  Milking
    An adult goat can be milked by using a bucket on it, yielding a milk bucket.

  Breeding
    Goats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding wheat. If adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven experience orbs. The growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat. If a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat. If both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance in Java Edition and a 98% chance in Bedrock Edition that the baby is a screaming goat. Otherwise, there is a 2% chance of a baby goat being a screaming goat. Baby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: /summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasLeftHorn:1} or /summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasRightHorn:1}.
