Overview
    Polar bears are neutral mobs that live in icy biomes.

Spawning
    Polar bears spawn above grass or ice in snowy plains, ice spikes, regular and deep frozen ocean biomes in groups of up to two at light level 7 or higher. If there is a group, the second polar bear is a cub. They can also spawn in frozen rivers, legacy frozen oceans, snowy slopes, also sometimes at the jagged peaks, and the frozen peaks in Bedrock Edition.

Behavior
    Polar bears can exist in a passive or hostile state. The cubs are passive; adults are hostile when with cubs or provoked (unless it's killed in one hit‌[JE  only]), they also attack if a player gets near them in Bedrock edition. If a cub is attacked, unless killed in one hit‌[JE  only], all adults within a 41×21×41 area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of difficulty, although in Peaceful difficulty their attacks do zero damage to players. Attacking an adult who is within a 16×8×16 area of a cub also provokes other adults within a 21×21×21 area of the attacked adult.‌[JE  only] Polar bears also attack foxes. Polar bears attack by rearing on their back legs and mauling down with their front paws. Their swimming speed is equal to the player's, making them difficult to get away from if they are attacking in water. Polar bears cannot breed and cubs' growth cannot be sped up. They do not take freezing damage from powder snow.
