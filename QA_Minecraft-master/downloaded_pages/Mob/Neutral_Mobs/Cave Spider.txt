Overview
    Cave spiders are small variants of the spider that inflict Poison with their attacks. They are exclusively spawned by monster spawners found in mineshafts.

Spawning
    Cave spiders spawn from monster spawners in mineshafts at a light level of 0. These monster spawners are surrounded by cobwebs in corridors. ‌In Java Edition 1.21 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.0‌[upcoming], cave spiders have a chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for trial spawners in trial chambers.

Behavior
    Cave spiders inherit their behavior from spiders: They have some distinctions from regular spiders: Being arthropods, they are weak against weapons with the Bane of Arthropods enchantment.

  Poison
    On Normal or Hard, cave spiders inflict Poison upon attacking.[1] On Normal difficulty, the Poison lasts for 7 seconds and causes 6 damage. On Hard difficulty, it lasts for 15 seconds and causes 12 × 6. Poison damage is not taken when the player's health is at 1.
