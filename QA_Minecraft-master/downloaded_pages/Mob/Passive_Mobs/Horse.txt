Overview
    Horses are passive mobs that can be ridden when tamed and saddled.

Spawning
    Horses spawn in plains and savannas in herds of 2–6. For horses, all combinations of color and markings are equally likely. All members of the herd have the same color, but markings may vary. 20% of all individual horses spawn as foals. In Java Edition, all of individual horses spawn as adults when using spawn eggs.[1] Villages naturally generate with stables and animal pens containing horses.

Appearance
    Each horse variant has unique features and markings, and a foal (baby) version. Adult horses are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults, and in Bedrock Edition, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike wolves and cats, the appearances of horses do not change once they have been tamed, though tame horses may be differentiated by giving them equipment. Horses have a stocky build. They can have 1 of 7 base colors: white, buckskin, flaxen chestnut, bay, black, dapple gray, and dark bay; and 1 of 5 marking patterns: no markings, stockings and blaze, paint, snowflake appaloosa and sooty. In total, there are 35 possible horse coat combinations. Unlike almost all other mobs, horses with equipped saddles don't render these when under the effect of Invisibility.[2] Horse colors and markings

Usage
    Tamed and saddled horses can be used as a means of transportation in the game. When ridden, they are able to move faster and jump higher than a normal player. Horses can be used to climb hills and jump fences, as some can jump high enough to clear up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of about one (without jump boost). Horses cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.[3] Horses can be pulled along and tied up using a lead. They can be towed in two ways: Horses can swim behind a boat by using a lead, or a boat can be attached to a lead‌[Bedrock Edition  only] (before putting the horse in the boat) and the player can swim to tow the boat containing the horse.

  Equipment
    Tamed horses have the following two slots available: Foals cannot be equipped, as they cannot be ridden. Equipment can be placed on a horse by holding it and then using on the horse, or by accessing its inventory. A horse’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using inventory control, or by sneaking and then using or pressing the "open inventory" button ‌[Bedrock Edition  only] on the horse. A normal horse’s inventory has two slots, one for a saddle and one for horse armor.

  Riding
    Once a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, jump, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the dismount control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a horse. A ridden saddled horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap. The maximum speed of horses varies between 4.74 blocks/second and 14.23 blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.317 blocks/second). About 82% of horses are able to go faster than a minecart. Horses move backward slowly, about as fast as the player when moving sideways. A horse’s speed can also be affected by potions. Speed has no relation to a horse’s outward appearance. Ridden saddled horses have the ability of "jumping charging". In Java Edition, when the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar, and hunger bar is replaced by horse's health bar; in Bedrock Edition, both health bar and hunger can display, and only when jump charging, the experience bar is replaced by jumping charging bar, but the number over the experience bar is still visible. A ridden saddled horse can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Horses are not affected by jump boost beacons.

Behavior
    Horses wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to rear, flick their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. If a player comes near, the horses may turn to look at them. Any horse, even a wild or undead horse, can be attached to a lead without protest, although an untamed horse rears and flails its forelegs if saddled. Horses remain passive, even when hit. Horses make neighing and whinnying sounds. Adult Horses, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a boat. In Bedrock Edition, foals, however, can.[4] Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health. Horses can be led by a player holding a golden carrot, golden apple, or enchanted golden apple. Baby horses follow adult horses.

  Taming
    Taming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding. In Java Edition, a player mounts a horse by pressing use on it with an empty hand. In Bedrock Edition, the player can also hold an object that cannot be used on a horse. A player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player. Taming depends on the horse's "temper". Horses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0–99 is chosen. The horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold. Otherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse. Temper can also be increased by feeding the horse. After repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed. In Bedrock Edition, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.

  Breeding
    Feeding two tamed horses golden apples or golden carrots activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal. The foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster. Depending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types. This is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.

    Random markings,8.89%,8.89%,2.22%,20%
    Total,44.44%,44.44%,11.11%

  Food
    Feeding a horse food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods horses can take. Zombie and skeleton horses cannot be fed, even if tamed. In Bedrock Edition, the health of foals cannot be restored by feeding. In Java Edition, feeding tamed horses in full health has no sound effect and movements.[5][6]‌[until JE 1.20.3] In Bedrock Edition, while temper is at max value, untamed horses can be fed any food except hay bale. To feed a horse, hold a valid food item and press use on the horse.

Statistics
    All horses have three "equine stats" that vary from horse to horse: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height. These stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

  Spawned values
    When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs – horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges. Horse's hearts ranges from 15–30, with an average of 22.5 × 11.25. A horse with an odd number of health points does not show the last half-heart. Horse's movement speed ranges from 0.1125–0.3375 in internal units, with an average of 0.225. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any status effect that affects the speed of the horse or the player. The conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17. However, horses instead travel at just shy of 42.16 blocks/sec times their internal attribute, putting the best horse's maximum speed at 14.23 blocks/second, and the average horse's speed at about 9.49 blocks/sec. See also transportation methods to compare the speeds of various transportation methods. Horse's jump strength ranges from 0.4–1.0, with an average of 0.7. A jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1 9⁄16 blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear 5 3⁄8 blocks.

  Bred values
    When breeding two horses, or a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by averaging both parent's stats and adding a random variation to it. The variant of the child has an 11% chance to be a random base color, and a 20% chance to have random markings. Otherwise, it chooses the values from one of its parents.
