Overview
    A tadpole is a bucketable aquatic baby passive mob hatched from frogspawn. They mature into one of the three frog variants depending on the biome in which they mature.

Spawning
    Tadpoles hatch from frogspawn in groups of 2-5.

Drops
    As with other baby animals, tadpoles do not drop any items or experience on death.

Behavior
    Tadpoles swim aimlessly in water. On land, they flop around like fish and seek out nearest water. They die in less than 20 seconds after being out of water. Unlike frogs, tadpoles are hunted by axolotls. Tadpoles follow a player that is holding a slimeball. A player can pick up a tadpole with a bucket of water. A tadpole grows up into one of the variants of a frog depending on the tadpole's location, as shown on the table below. Tadpoles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes). Its growth may be accelerated by feeding it slimeballs. Each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%.
