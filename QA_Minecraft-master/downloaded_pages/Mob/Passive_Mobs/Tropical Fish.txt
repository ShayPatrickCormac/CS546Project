Overview
    Tropical Fish are common bucketable aquatic passive mobs found in oceans, mangrove swamps and lush caves. There are 2,700 naturally occurring variants of tropical fish of different colors and shapes with unique names.

Spawning
    In Java Edition, random varieties of tropical fish spawn in groups of 8 in lukewarm or warm oceans (as well as their deep variants) at Y-level 50 to 63, and in lush caves at any Y-level. They are subject to fish spawning requirements. In Bedrock Edition, tropical fish spawn underwater at 12-32 blocks away from the player. Tropical fish spawn only in warm, lukewarm, deep lukewarm ocean biomes and lush caves, in groups of 3-5 for the same preset pattern, and in groups of 1-3 for a random pattern. In addition, tropical fish in warm, lukewarm ocean and deep variants can spawn only at Y levels between 50 and 64 and must be on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top). Tropical fish in lush caves can spawn on any Y levels but require underground.

Behavior
    Tropical fish tend to swim in schools of fish (a maximum of nine tropical fish per school). Tropical fish are also able to go against the water flow. The player may collect a fish by using a water bucket on it, which gives the player a bucket of fish. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is used against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it.

  Weaknesses
    Tropical fish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until eventually they suffocate and die. In Bedrock Edition, they rotate when flipping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.[1] Fish have a weakness to weapons that have the Impaling enchantment, which also affects squid, turtles, guardians, elder guardians and dolphins.‌[Java Edition  only]

Varieties
  Java Edition
    When tropical fish spawn in the wild, 90% of the time they appear as schools of one of the 22 varieties seen on the right, and the other 10% of the time their patterns, size, and colors are completely random, drawn from any of 2 shapes, 6 patterns, 16 base colors, and 16 pattern colors. The color black is not supposed to appear on any naturally-spawned tropical fish, since the eyes are usually hard to see[2], but due to a bug[3] black can be chosen randomly. This results in 3,072 naturally-occurring combinations, instead of the intended 2,700. Tropical fish can be summoned with black as one or both of their colors, and/or without any visible pattern,[more information needed] though even without the pattern they can still have a pattern color, causing a further 884 possible combinations, 480 of which look the same due to the missing pattern.

  Bedrock Edition
    Tropical fish do not have common varieties in Bedrock Edition. Instead, naturally spawned tropical fish have 2 spawn attempts, the first chooses one of the 22 preset variants, and the other use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).
Tropical fish spawned from a spawn egg use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).
By using commands, tropical fish may be spawned as one of the 22 preset variants (due to MCPE-117477, Yellowtail Parrot Fish do not spawn, therefore only 21 preset variants exist on Bedrock Edition).

  Names
    Tropical fish variants in buckets have names that are assigned based on their colors and type. In Bedrock Edition, the names are in the name of the bucket, giving names like "Bucket of Dottyback", "Bucket of Sky-Orange Snooper", or "Bucket of Orange-Lime Dasher". In Java Edition, the type, and colors are displayed as item tooltips. In Bedrock Edition, the following colors are renamed from their defaults when they refer to tropical fish. Parentheses indicate default name and color id - see § Entity data. The base color is first, and the pattern color is next if it is different. The fish type is determined according to the shape and pattern of the fish:

    Some varieties of tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system; instead, they reference real-life fish species. In Java Edition, these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties. In Bedrock Edition, there are also 22 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as in Java Edition. These uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior. These varieties are:
