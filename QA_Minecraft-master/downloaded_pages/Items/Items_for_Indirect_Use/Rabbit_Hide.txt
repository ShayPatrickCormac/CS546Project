Overview
    Rabbit hide is an item dropped by rabbits.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Rabbits drop 0–1 rabbit hide upon death. The maximum number of drops can be increased by 1 per level of Looting used, for a maximum of 0–4 rabbit hides with Looting III. Some foxes spawn holding rabbit hides, which always drop upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item, which causes the fox to drop the rabbit hide.

  Cat gifts
    Tamed cats have a 70% chance of giving the player a gift when they wake up from a bed, and the gift has a 16.13% chance to be a rabbit hide.

Usage
    Rabbit hide can be crafted into leather, or into bundles to store stacks of items.
