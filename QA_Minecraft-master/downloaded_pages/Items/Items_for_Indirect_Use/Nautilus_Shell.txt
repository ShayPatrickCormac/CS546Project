Overview
    A nautilus shell is an item that is used for crafting conduits.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Drowned have a 3%‌[JE  only] or 8%‌[BE  only] chance to spawn with a nautilus shell in their off-hand, and this nautilus shell always drops upon death.

  Fishing
    Nautilus shells can be rarely obtained as a treasure item from fishing. The drop chances of nautilus shells slightly increase with each level of Luck of the Sea on the player's fishing rod.

  Trading
    Wandering traders may sell a nautilus shell for 5 emeralds each, but they only sell 5 of them at a time.

Usage
    In Bedrock Edition, a nautilus shell is one of the few items that can be held in the off-hand.
