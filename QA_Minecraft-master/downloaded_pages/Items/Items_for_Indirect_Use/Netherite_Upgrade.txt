  Smithing ingredient
    While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite gear retains the enchantments, prior work penalty and number of durability points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond gear. Upgrading gear does not remove incompatible enchantments, such as multiple different Protection enchantments. Unlike anvils, using a smithing table to upgrade diamond gear to netherite gear costs no experience and does not increase the prior work penalty.
