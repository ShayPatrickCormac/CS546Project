Overview
    Prismarine crystals are items obtained by defeating guardians or elder guardians. They are used along with prismarine shards to craft sea lanterns.

Obtaining
  Mining
    Prismarine crystals are dropped by sea lanterns when not using a Silk Touch tool. They drop 2–3 crystals each time, which can be increased to a maximum of 5 using the Fortune enchantment.

  Mob loot
    Guardians and elder guardians have a 40% chance and 1⁄3 chance, respectively, of dropping prismarine crystals upon death. The maximum drop count is increased by one per level of Looting.
