Overview
    A heart of the sea is a rare item that can be crafted into a conduit.

Obtaining
    The heart of the sea must be found. It cannot be crafted or obtained by trading, making it a non-renewable resource. A heart of the sea is obtained from a buried treasure. The location is marked with a noticeable red X on a buried treasure map, which is found in ocean ruins and shipwrecks. Feeding raw cod or raw salmon to a dolphin causes the dolphin to swim toward the nearest buried treasure, shipwreck, or ocean ruins.
