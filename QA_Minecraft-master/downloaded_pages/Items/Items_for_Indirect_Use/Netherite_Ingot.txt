Overview
    Netherite ingots are items obtained from crafting netherite scraps and gold ingots together, as well as loot from bastion remnant loot chests. Unlike other items, they are immune to fire and lava but are still destroyed by cactus. They are primarily used to upgrade diamond gear and craft lodestones.

Obtaining
    Netherite ingots are obtained by crafting four netherite scraps and four gold ingots. It is a shapeless recipe, therefore the placement of the netherite scraps and gold ingots does not matter when crafting it.

    Netherite ingots are the repair items for the netherite tier and armor material, and thus can be used to repair the following items in an anvil:

  Beacons
    A netherite ingot could be used to select powers from a beacon instead of using an emerald, gold ingot, iron ingot, or a diamond. The player must select one of the available powers, and then insert an ingot in the item slot. The gold option is more efficient than the netherite option because it consumes 3 fewer gold and no netherite scrap.
