Overview
    A nether star is a rare item dropped by the wither that is used solely to craft beacons.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Nether stars can be obtained only by defeating withers. One nether star is dropped each time; the dropped amount is not affected by the Looting enchantment. In Java Edition, nether stars are immune to explosions, and those dropped by withers take 10 minutes to despawn. In Bedrock Edition, nether star items never despawn, neither by time nor by explosions.

Usage
    Nether stars have the same animated glint as enchanted items and end crystals. A dropped nether star item cannot be destroyed by explosions. However, it can still be destroyed by a falling anvil,‌‌[Java Edition  only] fire, lava, cacti, or the void.
