Overview
    A slimeball is a crafting ingredient commonly dropped by slimes, and can be sneezed out by pandas.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    If a slime's size is 1, it drops 0–2 slimeballs when killed. The maximum number of slimeballs is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5 slimeballs with Looting III. Baby pandas have a 1⁄700 chance of dropping one slimeball when sneezing.

  Breeding
    Slimeballs can be used to breed frogs and reduce the remaining growth duration of tadpoles by 10%. Both also follow a player holding a slimeball.
