Overview
    Glowstone dust is an item obtained from mining glowstone, and is mainly used to create potions with increased strength and decreased duration.

Obtaining
  Mining
    When broken using anything other than a Silk Touch-enchanted tool, a glowstone block drops 2-4 glowstone dust. A Fortune enchantment increases the chances of higher drops, with Fortune III allowing an average yield of 3.5 glowstone dust per block.

  Mob loot
    Witches have a chance of dropping 0–6 glowstone dust upon death. This is increased by 3 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-15 glowstone dust.

  Trading
    In Bedrock Edition, journeyman-level cleric villagers sell one glowstone dust for 4 emeralds as part of their trades.
