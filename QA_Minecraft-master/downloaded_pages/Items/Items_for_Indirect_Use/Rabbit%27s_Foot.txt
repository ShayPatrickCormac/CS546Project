Overview
    A rabbit's foot is a brewing item obtained from rabbits.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Each rabbit has a 10% chance to drop a rabbit's foot when killed by the player. This chance can be increased by 3% per level using a sword enchanted with Looting. A fox sometimes spawns with a rabbit's foot in its mouth, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item, which causes the fox to drop the rabbit's foot.

  Cat gifts
    A tamed cat has a 70% chance of giving the player a gift when the player wakes up from a bed, and the gift has a 16.13% chance to be a rabbit's foot.
