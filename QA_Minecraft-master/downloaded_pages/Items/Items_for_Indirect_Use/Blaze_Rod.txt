Overview
    Blaze rods are items exclusively obtained from blazes. They act as a fuel for both brewing and smelting, and are required to craft eyes of ender used to access to the End.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    When killed by a player or tamed wolf, a blaze has a 50% chance to drop a blaze rod. The Looting enchantment can increase the drops by one per level, for a maximum of 4 blaze rods. Blazes do not drop any blaze rods if killed by any other source.
