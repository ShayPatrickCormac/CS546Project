Overview
    Cookies are food items that can be obtained in large quantities, but do not restore hunger or saturation significantly.

  Trading
    Journeyman-level farmer villagers sell 18 cookies for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.

  Villager gifts
    in Java Edition, if the player has the Hero of the Village effect, a farmer villager may gift them a cookie.

Usage
  Food
    To eat a cookie, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger 
saturation.

  Parrots
    Feeding a cookie to a parrot kills the parrot instantly, and causes it to give off Poison particles as it dies due to chocolate being toxic to parrots. If the parrot was tamed, the death message Parrot was killed by [player] will be displayed.
In Bedrock Edition, feeding a cookie to a parrot inflicts the parrot with Fatal Poison for 1,000 seconds.

  Composting
    Placing a cookie into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Considering the high yield of cookies (8 cookies from 1 cocoa bean and 2 wheats) and the higher chance to successfully compost a cookie (85%), it is more efficient to craft cookies to compost rather than using separate ingredients. For example, 100 wheats and 50 cocoa beans, which in total could yield only 13.92 bone meal on average, could be crafted into 400 cookies to yield 48.57 bone meal on average.
