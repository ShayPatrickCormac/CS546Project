  Mooshrooms
    Using a bowl on a mooshroom turns the bowl into mushroom stew or suspicious stew. The stew can then be consumed immediately and the process repeated, making this an excellent way to quickly restore depleted hunger and saturation with almost no cost or effort.

  Fuel
    Bowls can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per bowl in Java Edition, and 1 item per bowl in Bedrock Edition.
