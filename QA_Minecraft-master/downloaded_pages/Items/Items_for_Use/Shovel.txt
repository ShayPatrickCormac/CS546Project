Overview
    Shovels are tools used to hasten the process of breaking dirt, sand, gravel and other soil blocks, as well as to convert dirt blocks into dirt paths.

Obtaining
    Wooden, stone, iron, golden, and diamond shovels are crafted using 2 sticks and 1 unit of tool material.

  Upgrading
    Like other diamond tools, a diamond shovel can be upgraded to a netherite shovel, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed and attack damage, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

    A shovel can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the tiers' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. It also keeps the shovel's enchantments.

  Mob loot
    Zombies and husks have a 0.67% (3.33% in Hard difficulty) chance of spawning with an iron shovel. They have an 8.5% (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) chance of dropping that shovel if they are killed by the player. The dropped shovel is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted: 0%–25% on Normal difficulty and 3.125%–25% on Hard difficulty, varying with regional difficulty, and enchanted as if on an enchanting table at level 5–22. Vindicators and pillagers that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance(5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron shovel that is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment.‌[Bedrock Edition  only]

  Trading
    Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell stone shovels for one emerald, journeyman-level toolsmith villagers have a 25% chance to sell enchanted iron shovels for 2 emeralds, and expert-level toolsmith villagers have a 50% chance to sell enchanted diamond shovels for 5 emeralds as part of their trades.‌[Bedrock Edition  only] Novice-level toolsmith villagers have a 40% chance to sell stone shovels for one emerald, journeyman-level tool smiths have a 40% chance to sell an enchanted iron shovel for 7-22 emeralds, and expert-level tool smiths have a 2⁄3 chance to sell an enchanted diamond shovel for 11-27 emeralds.‌[Java Edition  only] The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchanting table at levels 5–19.

Usage
  Digging
    A shovel can be used to break some materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability. Each different tier of shovel has a different durability:

    Material,Durability
    Wood,59
    Stone,131
    Iron,250
    Diamond,1561
    Golden,32
    Netherite,2031

    The following table summarizes the speed at which different quality shovels perform on different block types. Values with a red background indicate that no resource is dropped when the block is destroyed without a shovel.
