  Upgrading
    Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.

Usage
  Mining
    A netherite pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a netherite pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

  Weapon
    All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Netherite pickaxes do 6 damage per attack, or 7.2 damage per second. All pickaxes attack instantly, with netherite pickaxes doing 7 damage per attack.
