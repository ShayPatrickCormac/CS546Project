Overview
    A melon slice[a] is a food item that can be eaten by the player.

Obtaining
  Block loot
    Melon slices can be obtained by breaking (harvesting) melons using any tool or by hand. Axes, followed by swords, are the fastest tools for harvesting melons.  A melon drops 3â€“7 melon slices, when broken; by hand, using a tool, or after being broken by the movement of a piston, with an average of 4.64 slices per melon. Breaking a melon with a tool enchanted with Fortune increases the potential number of drops by 1 slice per level, up to a maximum of 9 slices.
