Overview
    A diamond pickaxe has a mining level of 3, being stronger than an iron pickaxe but weaker than a netherite pickaxe. It is crafted using three diamonds and two sticks, giving 1 diamond pickaxe as a result. The fourth tier of pickaxe is known for being the first tier able to mine obsidian, a key ingredient in making a nether portal to access the Nether.

  Trading
    In Bedrock Edition, master-level toolsmith villagers always sell enchanted diamond pickaxes for 13 emeralds. In Java Edition, master-level toolsmith villagers always sell an enchanted diamond pickaxe for 18–35 emeralds. The enchantments are the same as the ones obtained from an enchantment table at levels 5–19.

Usage
  Mining
    A diamond pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a diamond pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers. A diamond pickaxe or better is necessary for mining obsidian (including crying obsidian), respawn anchors, ancient debris and blocks of netherite.

  Weapon
    All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Diamond pickaxes do 5 damage per attack, or 6 damage per second. All pickaxes attack instantly, with diamond pickaxes doing 6 damage per attack.

  Enchantments
    A diamond pickaxe can receive the following enchantments:

    Name,Description,Max Level,Method,Weight
    Efficiency,Increases the mining speed.,V,,10
    Fortune [note 1],Increases the amount of drops when mining.,III,,2

    Mending,Repairs the pickaxe when obtaining experience .,I,,2
    Curse of Vanishing,"The pickaxe vanishes on death, not dropping as an item.",I,,1

  Upgrading
    Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.
