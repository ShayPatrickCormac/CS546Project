  Fishing
    Name tags can be caught from fishing as part of the treasure category with a 1‚ÅÑ6 chance after the 5% chance of being a treasure catch. The chance of catching treasure increases with the Luck of the Sea enchantment.

  Trading
    Master-level librarian villagers offer to sell a name tag for 20 emeralds as one of their available trades.

Usage
    To use a name tag, it must first be renamed with an anvil, costing 1 experience level. If it is not renamed, it has no effect when used on a mob. After the name tag is renamed, the player can use it on a mob to give it the name given to the name tag from the anvil. Mobs and name tags can be renamed any number of times. Name tags with the same name are stackable. Once a mob is named, it keeps its name, and the name tag is consumed. When a mob is named, it is excluded from the mob cap count. Effects on various mobs:

  Limitations
    Any mob can be named except for the ender dragon and players. A name tag can rename an armor stand, though it does not show the nameplate above its head until CustomNameVisible:1b is set as an extra step. Using a name tag on a villager renames the villager instead of opening the trading interface. A saddled pig is renamed instead of being ridden. Using a name tag on any other mob that can be interacted with performs the use action instead of being named. These mobs can be renamed if the player uses the name tag while crouching or standing in a nether portal because the portal suppresses the use action. Once a name tag is used on a mob, it is impossible to remove the name of that mob without the use of commands or external modifications.

  Behavior
    Renamed mobs have their name displayed over their head in the same fashion as a mob named through a renamed spawn egg. Their names can be seen only if they are aimed at from four or fewer blocks away. Mobs that are named using the name tag never despawn in the world, similar to tamed mobs.[1] The exceptions are wandering traders or if the mob is hostile and the difficulty is switched to "Peaceful", causing any hostile mobs or any named hostile mobs to despawn immediately. If a renamed mob kills a player, the custom name is used in the death message in place of the mob type name. For instance, if a vindicator named "Johnny" kills a player, the death message is "Player was slain by Johnny". A renamed wither also has a renamed health bar, and the boss bar doesn't regenerate[verify].
