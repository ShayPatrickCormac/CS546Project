Overview
    A beetroot is a food and dye ingredient.

Obtaining
  Farming
    Beetroots are obtained from harvesting a fully grown crop block, which drops 1 beetroot and 1-4 seeds (2 5⁄7 seeds per plant harvested on average). Seed yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5 3⁄7 seeds per plant. These crops can be found growing in villages or can be grown from planted beetroot seeds.

Usage
  Food
    A beetroot can be eaten to restore 1 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation. Six beetroots can be crafted into beetroot soup, which restores six times the hunger and saturation of a single beetroot.
