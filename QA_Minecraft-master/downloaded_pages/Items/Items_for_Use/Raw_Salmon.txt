Overview
    Raw salmon is a food item that can be eaten by the player or cooked to make cooked salmon.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Salmon always drops 1 raw salmon when killed, unaffected by Looting.[1] If it is killed while on fire, it drops 1 cooked salmon instead. Guardians and elder guardians have a 2.5% chance to drop a random fish, with 25% of them being raw salmon, which drops as cooked if the guardian was on fire. The chance of getting the fish drop is increased by 1% per level with Looting (for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III), but the type of fish is not affected. Polar bears have a 25% chance of dropping 0–2 raw salmon when killed. The maximum amount can be increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III. If killed while on fire, they drop cooked salmon instead.

  Fishing
    Raw salmon can be obtained from fishing. The wait time of one being caught is decreased with the Lure enchantment and the chance of one being caught is slightly decreased with the Luck of the Sea enchantment (named as such because it increases treasure, not fish). Catching salmon awards 1-6 experience.

  Villager gifts
    in Java Edition, Fisherman villagers throw raw salmon at players under the Hero of the Village effect.

  Cats
    Raw salmon can be used to tame cats with 1⁄3 chance of success, get cats off of chests, and beds, breed cats, and make baby cats grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time. Additionally, raw salmon can be used to heal cats by 2. Raw salmon can be used to gain ocelot trust, breed ocelots, and make baby ocelots grow up by 10%.

  Dolphins
    A dolphin can be fed raw salmon to increase its trust of the player and cause it to interact with the player more often. However, unlike most other animal mobs, this does not cause them to breed. Additionally, dolphins swim to the nearest chest in a shipwreck or underwater ruin after they are fed raw salmon. If the chest in the nearest structure is broken, they swim to another structure with a chest.

  Trading
    Apprentice-level Fisherman villagers have 50%‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or 2⁄3‌[Java Edition  only] chance to buy 6 raw salmon and one emerald for 6 cooked salmon. Journeyman-level Fisherman villagers offer to buy 13 raw salmon for an emerald.

  Wolves
    In Bedrock Edition, raw salmon can be fed only to wolves not at full health, healing them by 2. Unlike other wolf food, raw salmon cannot be used to breed wolves or to accelerate the growth of baby wolves.
