Usage
    Normally, the compass' needle points toward the world spawn point. The compass points to spawn when viewed in any way, including as a dropped item, in a player's hand, in an inventory or the crafting table, or in an item frame. The direction the needle points to is relative to the player who is viewing it. In the Nether or the End, the compass' needle spins and points in random directions. The compass can be used on a lodestone, after which it is named lodestone compass by default and points to that lodestone as long as the compass is in the same dimension as the lodestone, but if the compass is taken to a different dimension, it spins randomly, as a normal compass would in the Nether or the End. If the lodestone is destroyed, it also spins randomly, even if the lodestone is replaced afterward.  However, if a lodestone compass is placed in storage, the lodestone can be broken and replaced without the compass losing the attunement, as long as the compass remains in storage while the lodestone is missing. A lodestone compass appears enchanted, similar to the enchanted golden apple. Using /setworldspawn to change the world spawn also changes where the compass points.
