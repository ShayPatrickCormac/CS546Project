  Farming
    The poisonous potato is a rare drop when harvesting (destroying) potato crops; a fully grown plant has a 2% chance of dropping one in addition to the 2-5 regular potatoes.

Usage
    Poisonous potatoes cannot be planted on farmland or baked. They also have no use with the composter.[1]

  Food
    To eat a poisonous potato, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation and has a 60% chance of applying 5 seconds of Poison II, draining 4 points of health.
Interestingly, a poisonous potato actually restores double the hunger and saturation than a normal, unpoisoned potato. (A normal potato gives 1 () hunger and 0.6 saturation points.)
