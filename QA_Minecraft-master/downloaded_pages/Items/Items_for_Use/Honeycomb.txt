Overview
    Honeycombs are items obtained by shearing full bee nests and beehives. They are used to craft beehives, candles and honeycomb blocks, and can be applied as wax to many copper blocks to prevent them from oxidizing over time, as well as to signs to prevent them from being edited.

Obtaining
  Harvesting
    When a bee nest or beehive at honey_level 5 is sheared, it drops 3 honeycombs and angers any bees inside, causing them to attack. Having a lit campfire or lighting a fire underneath the nest or hive prevents the bees from becoming hostile. A dispenser with shears inside can be used to shear the nest without angering the bees. The honeycomb pops out as a dropped item.

Usage
  Signs
    Using a honeycomb on a sign or a hanging sign prevents the sign from being edited.

  Waxing
    Using a honeycomb on a block of copper changes the block into its waxed variant, preventing oxidation of the copper.
