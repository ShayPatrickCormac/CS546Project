Overview
    Steak (in Java Edition) or cooked beef (in Bedrock Edition) is a food item obtained from cows, mooshrooms, or from cooking raw beef.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    When a cow or mooshroom is killed, it drops raw beef. If a cow dies while on fire, it drops steak instead. If the cow is killed using a weapon with the Looting enchantment, the maximum number of steak drops increases by 1 per level.

  Cooking
    Raw beef can be cooked in a furnace, smoker, or campfire. Each steak removed from a furnace output slot gives 0.35 experience (22.4 experience per stack).
