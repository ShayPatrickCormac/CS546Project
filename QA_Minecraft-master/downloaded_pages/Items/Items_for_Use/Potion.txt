Overview
    Potions are bottled substances designed to inflict effects. They are created by brewing and, when drunk, give the player an effect for a certain amount of time. All potions are brewed from a water bottle, which is considered a type of potion but has no effects.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Witches can drop potions of Healing, Fire Resistance, Swiftness, or Water Breathing if they die while drinking that potion. Wandering traders have a chance to drop a Potion of Invisibility if they die while drinking the potion.

  Chest loot
    Two Health II potions can be found in the brewing stand on ships in end cities, and one splash potion of Weakness can be found in a brewing stand in igloo basements. in Bedrock Edition, the cauldron in a swamp hut contains a random potion.

  Brewing
    Almost all potions are obtained by brewing. The Potion of Luck‌[JE  only] and the Potion of Decay‌[BE  only] cannot be brewed. They can be obtained via commands, and are also available in the creative inventory in their respective versions.

  Bartering
    Piglins may barter a potion or a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a gold ingot.

  Fishing
    Water bottles can be fished up as junk items.

Usage
    Potions are used by pressing and holding use with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items. When consumed they bestow the corresponding status effect upo the player. Drinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it. A potion effect does not "downgrade" if a lower level is activated. For example, if a player has Regeneration II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect. Potions cannot be put into cauldrons.‌[JE  only]

  Modifiers
    Potions can be modified in five ways. The modifications of Enhancement and Extension are mutually exclusive. Enhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect. For example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time. Extending a potion generally makes it last 8⁄3 as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes. The usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness). Interestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect. Corrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like blindness. Corrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect. All of the "corrupted" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced. In Bedrock Edition, the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.

  Base potions
    Base potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.

  Uncraftable potion
    In Java Edition, the Uncraftable Potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay. It is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows. It can be obtained using the following command: /give @s minecraft:potion{Potion:"minecraft:empty"}. It is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.

  Undead mobs
    The effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies. Potions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them. In addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration. In Bedrock Edition, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion always registers as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.

  Mud conversion
    Using a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on dirt, coarse dirt, or rooted dirt converts it into mud, returning a glass bottle with it. This process can be automated with a dispenser.

  Filling cauldrons with potions
    In Bedrock and Legacy Console editions potion bottles may be used on a cauldron to fill it. Using a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it and fills the bottle. Potions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with water, but as an added bonus if you use a stack of arrows in a full cauldron you get a stack of tipped arrows. for 1 layer you get 16, 2 layers 32.

Custom effects
    In Java Edition, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using /give and the tag CustomPotionEffects, which is an array of effects for the potion. See Item format#Potion Effects for more information, and status effect for a list of effects and IDs.
