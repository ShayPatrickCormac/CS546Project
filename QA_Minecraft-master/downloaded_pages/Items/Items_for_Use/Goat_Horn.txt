Overview
    A goat horn is an item dropped by goats. It has eight variants, and each plays a unique sound when used which can be heard by players in a large radius.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    A horn is dropped when an adult goat rams a tree or any other hard block that occurs naturally where goats spawn. These include stone, coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, emerald ore, log, or packed ice. Goats do not ram other solid blocks. In Java Edition, these blocks are listed under the snaps_goat_horn tag, and can be modified by data packs. Up to two horns can be dropped from an adult goat. Regular goats may drop the Ponder, Sing, Seek, and Feel horns, while screaming goats drop the Admire, Call, Yearn, and Dream horns. A specific goat drops only one type of horn; that is, if a goat drops a Sing horn, its other horn is also a Sing horn.

Usage
    When used, they play a loud sound that can be heard from up to 256 blocks, but are also limited by the server view distance. Each horn variant plays a unique sound. There are eight variants, four of which are exclusive to screaming goats. There is a cooldown of seven seconds between each use of the horn. All goat horns are affected by this cooldown.
