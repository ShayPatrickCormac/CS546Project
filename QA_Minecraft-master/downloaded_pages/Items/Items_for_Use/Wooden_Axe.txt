Usage
  Chopping
    Wooden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block will cost 1 durability.[note 1]

  Durability
    A wooden axe has 60 durability,‌[Bedrock Edition  only] or 59 durability.‌[Java Edition  only]

  Stripping
    Using a wooden axe on a log, wood block, bamboo block turns it into a stripped log, stripped wood, or stripped bamboo, respectively. This will use 1 point of durability of the axe. Using a wooden axe on a waxed or somewhat oxidized Copper block will remove the wax if it has any, or otherwise remove a level of oxidization. This costs 1 point of durability.

  Weapon
    When used as a weapon, a wooden axe will lose 2 durability points. In Bedrock Edition, wooden axes attack instantly with no cooldown and do 1 less damage than a wooden sword, but it lowers the durablility of armour and shields faster than a sword would do. In Java Edition, a wooden axe will always disable a shield, though there should be a chance of it happening.[1] Damage done by a wooden axe is equivalent to that of a diamond sword, but it has a longer cooldown.
