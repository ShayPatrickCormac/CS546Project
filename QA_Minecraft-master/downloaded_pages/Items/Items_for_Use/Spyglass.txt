Usage
    To use a spyglass, the player selects it from the hotbar and clicks use while looking in the desired direction. Spyglasses are used to zoom in on a specific location in the player's field of view (FOV). The spyglass changes the FOV to 1⁄10 of the FOV set in options. By default, the FOV is set to 70° in Java Edition and 60° in Bedrock Edition, resulting in an FOV of 7° in Java Edition and 6° in Bedrock Edition through the spyglass. The player's FOV can be set from 30° to 110°, so the spyglass FOV can  range from 3° to 11°. Regardless of the situation, or status effects the player has, using the Spyglass always shows a FOV 1⁄10 of the FOV set in options. A square vignette is applied when in use, similar to the effect when wearing a carved pumpkin. Pressing F1 removes the vignette,‌[Java Edition  only][1][2] similar to a carved pumpkin. Hazy distant objects remain hazy when viewed in the spyglass. Mobs too distant to render also do not render in the spyglass. The spyglass shows a magnified view of what the player already sees. The player is slowed down while watching through the spyglass. When the player uses the spyglass continuously for 1 minute (1200 game ticks), the interface is automatically closed. If the player has a certain effect on their screen like fire, the spyglass does not remove that effect on the player's screen.
