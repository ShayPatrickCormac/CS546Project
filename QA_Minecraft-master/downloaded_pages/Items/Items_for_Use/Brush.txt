    Damaged Brush,"[[None, None, None], ['', '', None], [None, None, None]]","The durability of the two brushes is added together, plus an extra 5% durability."

Usage
    Using the brush on any block displays a brushing animation, slowing down the player and creating breaking particles, but not actually damaging the block or brush. When continuously brushing a suspicious block, a random item slowly emerges from it until it drops out, and the block turns into regular sand or regular gravel, depleting 1 durability point on the brush. It takes 96 game ticks (4.8 seconds) to brush a single suspicious block.
