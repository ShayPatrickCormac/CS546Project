Overview
    A totem of undying is an uncommon combat item that can save holders from death. It is dropped by evokers, which spawn in woodland mansions and raids.

Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Evokers always drop one totem of undying upon death. The drop rate is not affected by Looting.

Usage
    If the player is holding a totem of undying in the off-hand or main-hand slot and receives otherwise fatal damage, the totem saves the player from death. The totem of undying must be in the player's hand (main hand or offhand) for it to work—it does not work if it is in the hotbar, unless selected. Any mob that can hold a totem of undying (in a hand or in the mouth) can use it while holding it.‌[Java Edition  only] The totem can be used only once; it disappears after use. It does not prevent death caused by void damage, the /kill commands, or even a tipped arrow with harming effect damage.[1]

Effect
    When activated, the totem of undying restores 1, removes all existing status effects, then grants 40‌[BE  only] or 45‌[JE  only] seconds[2] of Regeneration II, 40 seconds of Fire Resistance I and 5 seconds of Absorption II. An animation shows the totem of undying appearing to hover in front of the player's screen, similar to the animation seen when a player receives the Bad Omen or Hero of the Village effect‌[BE  only] or encounters an elder guardian. When killed by an Instant Damage tipped arrow, the arrow's instant damage takes effect after the totem has been activated. The totem of undying also works in Hardcore mode.
