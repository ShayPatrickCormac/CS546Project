    In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, bone meal can be:

  Fertilizer
    Bone meal can also be used on the following plants to have a chance to increase their growth stage:

    Plant,Action
    Wheat Carrots Potatoes,The plant matures 2–5 growth stages.
    Beetroots,The plant has a 75% chance of growing to the next growth stage.
    Bamboo,Grows the bamboo by 1-2 stems.
    Melon Stem Pumpkin Stem,The planted stem matures 2–5 growth stages. Bone meal affects only the stem's growth; it does not cause melons or pumpkins to sprout from a mature stem.
    Saplings Azalea Flowering Azalea Mangrove Propagule (not hanging),"The sapling has a 45% chance of growing to the next growth stage, if possible. Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees as the third stage. A tree cannot grow unless the sapling is planted in proper ground and sufficient space is available. Using bone meal on such an obstructed sapling with no chance of growing wastes the bone meal."
    Sunflower Lilac Rose Bush Peony,"The corresponding item form drops, without destroying the original plant."
    Grass Fern Seagrass,"A one-block-high tall grass , fern , or seagrass (that is on grass block , dirt , coarse dirt , rooted dirt , farmland , podzol , mycelium , moss block , mud , or muddy mangrove roots ) grows into a two-block-high tall grass, fern, or seagrass."
    Mushrooms,"Has a 40% chance of growing into a huge mushroom if on grass block , dirt , coarse dirt , rooted dirt , farmland , podzol , mycelium , moss block , mud , or muddy mangrove roots ."
    Cocoa,The cocoa plant matures 1 growth stage.
    Sweet Berry Bush,Grows every stage.
    Sea Pickle,"If the sea pickle is on a coral block and in water at least 2 blocks deep, the sea pickle colony grows, and additional sea pickles generate nearby."
    Sugar Cane ‌ [ BE only ],The sugar cane grows to maximum height (three blocks tall).
    Kelp,"The kelp plant grows by 1 block per bone meal used, up to its maximum height."
    Flower (excluding wither rose and torchflower )‌ [ BE only ],One-block-high flowers make more flowers of the same type grow in the surrounding area.
    Fungus,"Grows into huge fungi , but only if on the respective nylium ."
    Weeping Vines,Grows the weeping vines a few blocks downward.
    Twisting Vines,Grows the twisting vines a few blocks upward.
    Cave Vines,Produces glow berries if the vine did not have any glow berries on it already.
    Glow Lichen,The glow lichen spreads to a random adjacent block.
    Moss Block,"The moss block causes nearby stone , cave vines , and dirt to become moss blocks."
    Big Dripleaf Small Dripleaf,"A big dripleaf grows one block higher, and a small dripleaf becomes a big dripleaf ."
    Rooted Dirt,Causes hanging roots to grow underneath the rooted dirt if there is space.
    Mangrove Leaves,Creates a hanging mangrove propagule under the mangrove leaves .
    Mangrove Propagule (hanging),The mangrove propagule matures 1 growth age.
    Pink Petals,"Produces another pink petal in the block. If there are already four pink petals in the block, it drops a pink petal as an item."
    Torchflower Crop Pitcher Crop,Grows every stage.

    Bone meal does not affect: Bone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:

  Creating new plants
    If bone meal is used on a grass block, tall grass, grass, flowers, and pink petals form on the targeted block and on random adjacent grass blocks in an 15×5×15‌[JE  only] or 7×5×7‌[BE  only] area centered on the targeted block. The flowers/pink petals that appear depend on the biome, meaning that in order to obtain specific flowers, the player must travel to biomes where the flowers are found naturally. See Flower § Flower biomes for more information. Using bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks. Using bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and surrounding blocks. Sometimes, if in a warm ocean biome, coral and coral fans may have a chance to generate as well. Coral (not coral fan) can be generated in any biome‌[Bedrock Edition  only]. In order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water. Using bone meal on a sea pickle on a coral block creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 blocks (of coral) away, so a 7 × 7 square (49 blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks). Using bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created. Using bone meal on nylium causes the corresponding nether roots and both types of fungi to appear on the nylium block and other nylium, netherrack, dirt or grass blocks nearby, with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on warped nylium creates nether sprouts and twisting vines.

  Farmer villagers
    Villagers with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full composter, with which they can make their crops grow faster.
