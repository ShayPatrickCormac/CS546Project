Usage
    Similar to how a carrot on a stick is used to control pigs, the players can use a warped fungus on a stick to control a strider. To do this, the player simply holds the item in one hand and any nearby striders within view is attracted toward the player. If mounted on a saddled strider, the strider moves in the direction the player is facing while holding the warped fungus on a stick. Right clicking with the item makes the strider go faster, but reduces the item's durability by 1 for every speed boost. If the item durability reaches 0, it turns into a fishing rod. Due to a strider's ability to walk on lava, this is a beneficial tool for using striders as a safe transport across the Nether's terrain, which is otherwise considered difficult to traverse.
