Usage
  Mining
    A stone pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a stone pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as torches and flowers.

  Weapon
    All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.83 seconds to recover. Stone pickaxes do 3 damage per attack, or 3.6 damage per second. All pickaxes attack instantly, with stone pickaxes doing 4 damage per attack.
