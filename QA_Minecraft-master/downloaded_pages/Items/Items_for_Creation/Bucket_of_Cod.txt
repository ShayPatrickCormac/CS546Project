Overview
    A bucket of cod is a cod inside of a water bucket, obtained by using a water bucket on a cod.

Obtaining
    A bucket of cod can be obtained by using a water bucket on a cod. Once a water bucket is used, the cod is picked up along with the water source block.

  Trading
    Novice-level fisherman villagers have a 50% chance to sell a bucket of cod for 3 emeralds.

Usage
    Pressing use with a bucket of cod places a water source block, and spawns the cod back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of cod in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the cod is spawned alone. Cods caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments. If a bucket of cod is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the cod and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up cods with water buckets (the bucket is emptied). If a bucket of cod is named a certain name through an anvil, the cod inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named cod is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of cod shares a name with the captured cod.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named cod is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
