Overview
    A bucket of salmon is a salmon inside of a water bucket, obtained by using a water bucket on a salmon.

Obtaining
    A bucket of salmon can be obtained by using a water bucket on a salmon. Once a water bucket is used, the salmon is picked up along with the water source block.

Usage
    Pressing use with a bucket of salmon places a water source block, and spawns the salmon back into the world, leaving an empty bucket in the player's inventory. Placing a bucket of salmon in the Nether causes the same particles to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the salmon is spawned alone. Salmon caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments. If a bucket of salmon is inside a dispenser, the dispenser spawns the salmon and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up salmon with water buckets (the bucket is emptied). If a bucket of salmon is named a certain name through an anvil, the salmon inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.‌[Java Edition  only] Alternatively, if a named salmon is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of salmon shares a name with the captured salmon.‌[Java Edition  only] If a named salmon is captured in Bedrock Edition, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
