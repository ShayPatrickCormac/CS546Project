Overview
    A minecart with command block is an impulse‌[JE  only] or repeating‌[BE & edu  only] command block inside a minecart.

Obtaining
    The minecart with command block is obtainable only using the command /give @s command_block_minecart, as it does not appear in the creative inventory‌[Bedrock Edition  only] and has no crafting recipe. It can also be summoned using the command /summon command_block_minecart. It can be broken like any other minecart, but only the minecart is retained, while the command block is lost.

Usage
    The minecart with command block combines the functionalities of both minecarts and command blocks. Although the minecart visually contains an impulse command block, it functions more similarly to a repeating command block, and runs its command once every four game ticks when on an active activator rail. When it passes over a detector rail with a comparator connected next to it, it outputs the command block's result.
