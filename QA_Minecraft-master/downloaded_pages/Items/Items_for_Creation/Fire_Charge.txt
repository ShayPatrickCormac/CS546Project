Overview
    A fire charge is an item that can be used as a single-use version of a flint and steel or shot as a small fireball from a dispenser. Small fireballs are incendiary projectiles fired by blazes and dispensers loaded with fire charges. They can set players and mobs on fire and create fires where they land.

Obtaining
    Despite firing small fireballs, blazes do not drop fire charges.

  Creating fire
    When a fire charge is used, it instantly places a fire, similar to flint and steel. The fire charge is consumed in the process. It can prime TNT, light nether portals, campfires, candles, cakes with candles and creepers‌[Java Edition  only] like flint and steel.

  Small fireballs
    When a fire charge is fired from a dispenser, it shoots a small fireball. Blazes also shoot small fireballs in volleys of three at a time as their ranged attack. Small fireballs, both when fired by dispensers and blazes, fly in a straight line through the air. Blazes fire small fireballs in the direction of whatever it is attacking. Dispensers fire them in the direction it is pointing. In both cases there is a random offset in a small fireball's trajectory due to a 'cone' of spread, which can cause small fireballs to miss or hit something else.[needs testing] If a small fireball hits a block, fire is placed at that location if possible. It produces no explosive effect. Small fireballs can light campfires and nether portals and can prime minecarts with TNT.[needs testing] If it hits an entity that is not immune to fire and does not have the Fire Resistance effect, the entity takes 5 of projectile damage regardless of difficulty level. The target is set on fire for 5 seconds, which does an additional 4 fire damage over time; it can deal up to 9 damage from these combined effects. Small fireballs can be blocked with a shield, which protects from damage and burning. Unlike ghast fireballs, small fireballs cannot be deflected by being hit.
