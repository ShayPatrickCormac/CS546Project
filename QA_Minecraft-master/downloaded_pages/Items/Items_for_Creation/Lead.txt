Obtaining
  Mob loot
    Wandering traders always spawn with 2 trader llamas, each held with a lead. When a trader llama is detached, either by killing it or the wandering trader, dragging them far apart, or putting the llama in a boat or a minecart, the lead drops at the llama's position.

  Leashing mobs
    Using a lead on a mob ties the lead to the mob, allowing it to be moved by the player. Multiple mobs can be held by leads at once, but each mob held requires its own lead. It is possible to leash the following mobs and other entities: Additionally, villagers, wandering traders, and monsters other than the ones listed above, can be leashed using a map editor or NBT editor. With a mob on a lead held by the player, using the lead on any type of fence (or wall‌[BE  only]) attaches the lead to it with a visible knot, tying the mob to it. To attach it to a wall on Bedrock Edition, the player must hold a lead in the main hand.[1] Multiple leads may be attached to one fence post. A mob tied to a fence tends to stay within 5 blocks of the fence post. A lead is broken by pressing the use item control on the mob again, hitting the knot, or removing the attached fence post. Leads also break when hit by projectiles. Whenever a lead is removed or broken, it drops as an item at the location of the mob. However, it does not drop when unleashed in Creative mode.‌[Java Edition  only][2] A lead does not break if the attached animal dies. A lead can stretch a maximum of 10 blocks. If the mob is able to move toward the player or fence post, it does so. If not, or if the mob is moving quickly away from the player, the lead breaks. When the player or the knot is more than 7 blocks above the ground, the mob being leashed becomes suspended. Most mobs that can be leashed can still be leashed even if attacking the player leashing them, and any attached leads do not break. Wolves cannot be leashed after becoming angry. Despite this, if they become angry while already leashed, the lead does not break, but it cannot be reattached when broken through other methods while the wolf is still angry. A lead attached to a hoglin breaks if it becomes a zoglin. A lead does not prevent mobs from despawning if they normally would despawn. When moving downward and accelerating toward the ground, leashed mobs accumulate fall damage and take it if they hit the ground while still accelerating. When moving up or decelerating (such as when the lead is stretched to its limit), the fall distance is set to one block and the mob therefore does not take any fall damage if it touches the ground. If the player walks into and back out of a nether portal while holding a lead connected to a mob, the lead remains attached to the mob. However, if a mob attached to a lead walks into a nether portal, the lead breaks and drops as an item in the other dimension. A lead can be used to remove a mob from a boat without needing to break the boat, if the mob can normally be leashed. If a chunk unloads while containing a leashed mob (either by the player walking too far away, or traveling to another dimension via a portal), the lead breaks and drops as an item, leaving the mob free to wander around.
