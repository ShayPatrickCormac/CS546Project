Overview
    The Moon is a joke dimension that can be accessed by flying up to Y=700 in the Overworld. The Moon has a weak gravitational pull. So weak, in fact, that at certain heights the player is pulled back to Earth, "falling up", so to say. The player's oxygen also decreases on the Moon, though much slower than in water. Cheese, which makes up almost the entirety of the Moon, restores both hunger and oxygen, allowing the player to survive here.

Accessing
    The Moon can be accesed by flying up to Y=700 in the Overworld. Conversely, flying up to Y=700 in the Moon brings the player back to the Overworld.
