Overview
    Punch is an enchantment for a bow that increases an arrow's knockback, much like the Knockback enchantment for melee weapons. This does not increase the damage of the bow.

Usage
    For each level, Punch adds approximately 3 blocks of distance to the base knockback. If commands are used to increase the level of Punch beyond 2, the additional knockback effect will cap at 255.

    Punch doesn't affect arrows shot from crossbows if applied using commands or an anvil in Creative mode.[1] Any level of Punch changes the vertical knockback of arrows from 0.8125 blocks to 1.25 blocks.

Obtaining
    Both Punch I and Punch II books can be obtained by fishing or by using an enchanting table. Punch I bows can be obtained by trading with an expert Fletcher. Skeletons may spawn with a Punch I bow on Normal or Hard difficulty.
