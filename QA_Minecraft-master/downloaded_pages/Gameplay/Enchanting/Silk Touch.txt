Incompatibilities
    Silk Touch is incompatible with Fortune. If commands are used to apply both Silk Touch and Fortune to an item, the Silk Touch enchantment takes precedence over the Fortune enchantment for blocks affected by both enchantments. Silk touch is also technically incompatible with the Looting and Luck of the Sea enchantments.‌[JE  only][4] If commands are used to apply both Silk Touch and Looting or Luck of the Sea to an item, both enchantments function normally. Silk Touch cannot be applied to swords or fishing rods in normal gameplay.
