Overview
    Mending is an enchantment that restores durability of an item using experience.

Obtaining
    Mending is a treasure enchantment; it can be obtained from jungle temple, stronghold, and ancient city chest loot, fishing, raid dropsâ€Œ[BE  only], or trading with a librarian of any level (or if the Villager Trade rebalance experimental datapack is enabled, a Master level Swamp Librarian).

Usage
Incompatibilities
    The Mending and Infinity enchantments are mutually exclusive, meaning only one can be added to any given item in survival. When added through use of commands, both enchantments function as normal.
