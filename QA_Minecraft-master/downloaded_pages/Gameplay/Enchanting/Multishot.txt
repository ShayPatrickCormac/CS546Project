Overview
    Multishot is an enchantment for crossbows that allow them to shoot three arrows or firework rockets at the cost of one.

Usage
    A crossbow with Multishot shoots three arrows on each shot, sending them in different directions (10Â° apart horizontally), but consumes only one arrow. Only the central arrow can be collected after shooting. In Java Edition, due to damage immunity, only one arrow from the same shot can damage the same mob; other arrows that hit that mob are deflected. Tipped/spectral arrows and firework rockets fired with a Multishot crossbow are duplicated in the same manner. Crossbows with the Multishot enchantment use three durability points per shot instead of the usual one point.

Incompatibilities
    Multishot and Piercing are mutually exclusive. However, if combined using commands or obtained using glitches, both enchantments function as normal, with the two extra arrows being able to pierce as well.
