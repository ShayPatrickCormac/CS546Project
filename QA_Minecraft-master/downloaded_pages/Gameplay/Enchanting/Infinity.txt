Overview
    Infinity is an enchantment for bows that prevents regular arrows from being consumed when shot. Only one arrow is needed to use a bow enchanted with Infinity.

Usage
    A bow enchanted with Infinity can be used to shoot unlimited arrows, as long as the player's inventory contains at least 1 arrow. Fired arrows cannot be retrieved except in Creative mode (in which they are erased instead of added to the player's inventory). Infinity has no effect on tipped and spectral arrows; they are still consumed as usual. A crossbow still consumes arrows if commands are used to add Infinity to it.

Incompatibilities
    Mending and Infinity are mutually exclusive. However, if combined with commands, both enchantments function as normal.
