Usage
  Speed
    Swift Sneak increases the player's speed while crouching by 15% per level. At Swift Sneak level 3, the player's crouch speed equals 75% of their normal walking speed. Swift Sneak 4 and 5 can further improve crouching speed, but the crouching speed can never be faster than the player's walking speed. This enchantment also increases the player's movement speed while they are crawling.
