Overview
    Piercing is an enchantment applied to a crossbow that causes arrows to pierce through entities.

Usage
    Arrows shot from a Piercing crossbow can pass through the number of entities equal to the enchantment level (for a total of level + 1 entities damaged). The shot arrows can still be retrieved after piercing a mob, allowing for infinite use of all arrow types, including spectral arrows and tipped arrows. Piercing ignores shields even when they are blocking. Arrows do not change direction upon piercing a mob, meaning they hit only mobs in the line of flight. Piercing has no effect on firework rockets fired from a crossbow. If commands are used to increase the enchantment level beyond 127, the piercing effect stops working and hits only one mob instead.

Incompatibilities
    Piercing and Multishot are mutually exclusive. However, if combined using commands, both enchantments function as normal, with the two arrows added by the Multishot enchantment getting the effect as well.
