Overview
    Lure is a fishing rod enchantment that decreases the wait time for a bite on the hook.

Usage
    Lure increases the rate of something biting the player's hook while fishing. Specifically, it decreases the wait time for something to appear by 5 seconds per level. See Fishing for more information. If commands are used to increase the enchantment level beyond 5, the wait timer does not start and fish do not bite.
