Overview
    Sweeping Edge is a sword enchantment that increases sweep attack damage.

Usage
    Sweeping Edge increases the damage dealt to mobs by each hit from a sweep attack to 50%/67%/75% of the sword's attack damage for levels I/II/III.

Mechanics
    If the attack recharge meter is 84.8% or above and the player is on the ground standing or moving slower than the sprinting speed in a straight line, the sword performs a sweeping attack indicated by a gale particle that reaches nearby enemies for 1 and knocks them back; the amount of knockback is 80% that of the basal knockback and does not benefit from the knockback enchantment. As result, the player can perform a sweep attack while they are sprinting diagonally but it is impossible to perform a sweep attack at the same time as a critical hit or while riding some entity. All enemies within a 1 by 0.25 by 1 block area of any part of the attacked mob, whose feet are at most 3 blocks away from the player's feet, are affected.

Damage
    The formula for sweep attack damage is: 1 + Attack_Damage × (Sweeping_Edge_Level / (Sweeping_Edge_Level + 1)), rounded to the nearest integer. Here, the Attack_Damage is the sword's damage after applying Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods. For example, an iron sword enchanted only with Sweeping Edge I deals 1 + 6 × (1 / (1 + 1)) = 4 damage to each mob hit with a sweep attack. A diamond sword enchanted with Sharpness V and Sweeping Edge III deals 1 + 10 × (3 / (3 + 1)) = 8.5 × 4.25 sweep damage. Any sword without Sweeping Edge deals 1 + Attack_Damage × (0 / (0 + 1)) = 1 sweep damage. Extra damage from Smite and Bane of Arthropods is applied against undead mobs and arthropod mobs, respectively. Higher levels than Sweeping Edge III (obtainable via the use of commands or third party editors) is processed following the formula above and the sweep damage caps beneath 100% of sword's attack damage. Enemies damaged through Sweeping Edge that are not directly hit by the sword are not affected by Fire Aspect.[1] For example, if multiple enemies are damaged by sweeping edge, only the first enemy struck will be affected by Fire Aspect.
