Overview
    Impaling is an enchantment for a trident, causing the trident to deal extra damage on each hit against aquatic mobs‌[Java Edition  only], or extra damage to mobs in water‌[Bedrock Edition  only].

Usage
    Each level of Impaling adds 2.5 ( × 1 1⁄4) extra damage per hit. In Java Edition, only aquatic mobs receive the extra damage. Aquatic mobs include axolotls, dolphins, guardians, elder guardians, squid, glow squids, turtles and [[fish|   all variants of fish]], but not drowned,[1] as drowned are classified as undead mobs rather than underwater mobs. In Bedrock Edition, as well as in Java Edition Combat Test 4 and after, the damage applies to all mobs and players when in contact with water: underwater, in flowing water, and in rain.[2]
