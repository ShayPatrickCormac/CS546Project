Overview
    Vine farming is a way to harvest large quantities of vines. Since vines can only be obtained when using a shear, you should be farming some iron too if you really need a lot of vines.

  Niondil's design
    Pretty easy design, all you have to do is hold down the attack button and you'll get vines. Uses water to move the player and the vines dropped.
