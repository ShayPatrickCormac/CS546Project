Overview
    This tutorial seeks to teach you how to farm seagrass, which are plants that are naturally found underwater.

Mechanics
    Seagrass spontaneously generates by applying bonemeal underwater. Applying bonemeal to seagrass will cause it to increase in height, similar to normal grass. This bonemeal can be applied by a dispenser, but the player can only obtain the item by breaking it with shears, making fully automatic farms impossible.

Manual Farming
    Seagrass can be manually farmed by applying bonemeal to as many underwater surfaces as possible. This will get seagrass for the player very quickly.

AFK Farming
    Seagrass is easily farmed by simply applying bonemeal to an underwater surface and then AFK-left clicking with shears. New shears can be given to the player as they break, allowing for continuous farming.
