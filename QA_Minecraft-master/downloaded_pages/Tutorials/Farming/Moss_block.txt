Overview
    Moss farming is using the feature of applying bone meal to a moss block and getting more moss blocks, as well as azalea and flowering azalea (which is a more efficient way to farm oak wood), moss carpet, seeds and grass. You can also farm bone meal using moss, because it produces more bone meal than it uses. You can also use the moss block's mechanics to terraform an area since it replaces most blocks around it with moss blocks. Moss blocks are hard to obtain without applying bone meal to existing moss blocks, with the only other methods being to find them from shipwrecks or buy them from wandering traders, so having a way to farm them can be very useful.

Manual farming
    What you need: 1 moss block, Some bone meal, A stone hoe or higher instantly breaks moss blocks All you need to do is place a moss block, then use bone meal on it, and mine it with the hoe. Then go to a different space and repeat the process. This mechanic might not seem like much, but you can use it for moss mining since moss replaces stone and deepslate with moss but not ores. You won't even need to bring more than one pickaxe, just hoes and bone meal.

Automatic moss farming
    Moss blocks can be farmed automatically by applying bone meal to stone made by a stone generator, since cobblestone is not able to be replaced by moss. They can be harvested with pistons because they get crushed if they do, or they can be harvested manually with a hoe.[1] You can then transport the drops using water flows which can carry it to a collection system, such as a hopper minecart one, which, if you want, you can compost and then turn into more bone meal.
