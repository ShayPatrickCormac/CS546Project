Common fixes
  Reinstalling Minecraft
    One of the common ways to fix an ailing Minecraft installation of various bugs is to simply re-install it.  Removing the launcher itself (the file you downloaded) however will not remove Minecraft.  The steps below should work for most people.
Important step: Be sure to do a forced update if you still have issues. Be careful, do not continue if your terminal gives you an error. The next command deletes your minecraft folder so if the prior command did not work all your hard work would be lost! Do NOT Run this under sudo or the root user Alternatively, open up your Home folder and press Ctrl+H. This shows all hidden files and folders. Navigate down to .minecraft. From here, you can work in essentially the same way as outlined in the instructions for Windows above.

  Latest Version
    If you are having issues after a reinstall, or are having other client issues, you can try using forced update.

  Reinstalling/Updating Java
    If Minecraft is not working due to an issue with Java, your Java install may be corrupt and/or out of date. To remedy a corrupt install, begin by uninstalling Java. After the uninstall is complete, you can then try reinstalling., For Windows users, it is sometimes (rarely) necessary to use an uninstaller program, such as Revo Uninstaller (free) to remove Java. Revo will search in-depth for all things Java, and remove the files., To re-download/update Java, visit Java's download page here. Download the correct version (of Java 8) for your machine, based on what operating system you have., Make sure you be careful with all instructions! (Anyone can edit this page)

  Updating video drivers ("Bad video card drivers!"... et alia)
    If Minecraft has poor performance, has graphics that are distorted, or is simply not working, it's possible that you need a driver or an updated driver installed., Some graphics cards only accept drivers from the manufacturer of the computer (i.e. Dell, HP, Toshiba). Visit the support site of the company that affects you, if that ends up being the case for you., Windows Update is not a good method for updating video drivers. If a generic driver is installed, you should remove it before installing a new driver. Create a system restore point, or perform a driver rollback if you experience issues after installing a new driver., If further help is need the video in the link may help you to fix this error - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zkpyLMSFB0 AMD users: Use the AMD Driver Autodetect utility to automatically find your driver.

  Syncing worlds across multiple computers
    All of your single-player worlds are stored in the saves folder within your installation folder. There is a subfolder for each world. The following steps will link your .minecraft/saves folder with a Dropbox account. The way in which you do this depends on your OS. Please note that dropbox provides 2GB of free storage, after which you will have to pay a monthly subscription fee to expand your storage. Google Drive gives you 15GB of free storage. The following steps assume that you have set Dropbox up to use the default folder and that you have not changed the .minecraft folder. Make sure that Minecraft and the Minecraft Launcher are closed before proceeding. This takes advantage of some of the UNIX underpinnings of the OS. This uses symbolic links so you will need to get under the hood a little bit. This uses symbolic links so you will need to get under the hood a little bit. If you want to simply manually back them up for later use, you can either copy out the whole saves folder or just the world folder that you want to backup.  If you want to move the order to the worlds in the saved menu, just change the number at the end of the world folder name to adjust the order as you would like.
