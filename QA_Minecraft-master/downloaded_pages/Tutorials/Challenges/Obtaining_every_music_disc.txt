Overview
    This tutorial covers strategies to obtain each type of music disc. Music discs are essential to duplicating allays and collecting every music disc could be pursued as a personal challenge.

Skeletons and creepers
    Most music discs, except Pigstep, Otherside, 5, and Relic can be obtained if a skeleton or stray shot kills a creeper. It is recommended to set up a farm for this. Additionally, if a skeleton or stray with an arrow lit on fire (either from having a bow enchanted with flame or by shooting through lava) hits a block of tnt which explodes a creeper, it will drop a music disc.

Chest loot
  13 and Cat
    13 and Cat can be found in dungeon, woodland mansion, and ancient city chests.

  Mellohi and Waitâ€Œ[BE  only]
    Mellohi and Wait can be found in buried treasure chests.

  Pigstep
    Pigstep can be found in bastion chests.

  Otherside
    Otherside can be found in stronghold and dungeon chests. It can also be found in ancient city chests excluding ice box chests.

  5
    5 can only be crafted from nine disc fragments found in ancient city chests excluding ice box chests.

  Relic
    Relic has a 8.3% chance of being obtaining by brushing suspicious gravel in trail ruins.
