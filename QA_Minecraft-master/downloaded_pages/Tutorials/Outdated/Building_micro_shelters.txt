Overview
    A micro shelter is a compact shelter that fits a large amount of utilities in a minimal amount of space. It can be built very quickly, and requires very few supplies to build.

Micro shelter with anvil
    It is similar to the micro shelter, but is updated and have space for an anvil.

  Construction
    2. Place a bed beside the hole. 3. Place the chests below the bed. 4. Place a slab in front of the chest. 5. Place a crafting table and an anvil beside the slab. 6. Place the solid blocks as the walls. Also place the doors. 7. Place the torch on the wall. 8. Place the furnace on the roof in the way that it can be accessed outside, see picture. Or you can place the furnace above your head when you're standing on the slab inside. 9. Place the slabs as roof. 10. (Optional) Place the glass as the window. If you use a pane, you must place a block beside it to close the gap.

    Step,Image,Description
    1,,"Place 2 blocks, and put a bed on top. Break the blocks, but leave the bed floating."
    2,,"Dig a hole one block deep along one side of the bed. Fill the hole with water. Use the hoe on the dirt under the bed. (If the squares aren't dirt or grass, dig them out and replace them with dirt.)"
    3,,"Build walls, two-high around the bed, with gaps as follows: Don't block over the water yet, and also leave one space for a doorway at the head of the bed (opposite the water)."
    4,,"Place blocks over, but not inside of the water. Place only the one layer, not a full wall."
    5,,Place the chests on top of the new blocks.
    6,,"Break the two blocks above the head of the bed, and fill the space with the crafting table and furnace."
    7,,Place a door where the yellow block is. Make sure to place from the inside .

    Mini shelters are slightly larger shelters that provides an extra anvil and some space, finally! You do spawn on the roof, but it is safe to jump off.
