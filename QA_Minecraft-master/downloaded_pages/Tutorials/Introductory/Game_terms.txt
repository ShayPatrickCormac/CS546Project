Overview
    This is a glossary of game terms used by the Minecraft community, but are not officially in the game. Some of these game terms are used as shortenings, while others are terms exclusive to Minecraft, and may not be familiar to people who are new to the game. Underlined words represent terms that are further described in this list. Terms that exist on other dedicated pages are not listed here.

List of terms
  A
    admin / operator
A player who is listed on the OP (operator) list, having access to most or all of the commands on a server.
Adminium
Bedrock. Back in the days of Classic Creative, bedrock was referred to as "Adminium" because the admins were the only ones who could use it, and there was no in-game item names yet.
AFK
Away From Keyboard: when a player is away from their computer, tabbed out, or otherwise not paying attention to what's happening in the game.
AFK farm
A farm that requires a player to function by making the player perform tasks automatically, exploiting interacting mechanics in a way that the player doesn't have to be actively involved due to the fact it requires only one, more or even no keys to be held indefinitely, which can be done by a weight placed on the keyboard/mouse or by exploiting an alt-tabbing glitch.
AFK farming
When an AFK player runs an AFK farm.

  B
    base
Home of a player, usually a place with their storage, some workstations (crafting table, furnace, etc.) and a frequently visited place.
beef
Shortening of raw beef. Can also refer to steak which is called Cooked Beef in Bedrock Edition.
blacksmith
A name generally used for the Weaponsmith, as it was the name for it before the Village & Pillage update. If used for the villager's building, it commonly describes the Weaponsmith plains house, although it can be used to describe any of its other types of houses.
block verb
To obstruct something; to block with the sword (pre 1.9) / shield.
block clutch
The act of quickly placing blocks on a vertical wall below the player's feet. This can be used to prevent fatal falls, hold onto a certain place, or move along the side of the wall.
Bolan diamonds / diamond-clay trick
A trick that allowed you to mathematically locate blobs of ore using clay or gravel disks in rivers or swamps, typically used to efficiently mine for diamonds. Named after Minecraft content creator Matthew Bolan, who first discovered and showcased the method. This trick no longer works as of Java Edition 1.18.
bridge verb
The act of crouching on a ledge and placing blocks while moving. Used to get across gaps, such as between mountains, or over the void in the End. Many versions of bridging exist, such as ninja bridging and god bridging, varying in speed and difficulty, often performed without always crouching.
buff noun
A special ability, granted by modded servers (modified attributes, e.g. flying in Survival mode, or higher speed than usual, not to be confused with the potion effect here), or granted in vanilla, like status effects. Debuff refers to a negative effect. In video game balancing, the term buff also refers to a change that increases the value of a certain element.
butter
Jargon or a joke term for gold. Most likely due to the appearance of gold ingots in-game. Rarely used in modern Minecraft.

  C
    cave noises / sounds
Refers to ambient sounds that occasionally play in dark or underground areas based on the mood algorithm.
cheater / griefer / hacker
The toxic part of the community; sometimes typed differently to avoid chat censoring (e.g. Haxor), it describes someone using modified clients to gain unfair advantages. Most servers forbid the use of those clients, and their use is not moral as well. However, some servers also forbid accusing players of being hackers on chat and whisper, but do provide an alternative method of reporting to staff like forums or dedicated in-game commands.
cheese
Any strategy that removes most, if not all danger from fighting a mob or performing any task that would usually be difficult. An example of a cheese strategy is a 2-block tall roof, which prevents enderman and wither skeletons from reaching you.
Another example could be using high FOV to x-ray through walls.
cobble
A shortening for cobblestone.
combat log verb
To disconnect from a server during combat to avoid death, usually in PvP.

Golden Apple; may refer to the enchanted one too, however, a term for those is also Notch Apple (official until 1.12, as seen on achievements), God Apple, or Enchanted Golden Apple (now official, as seen by its in game item name).
gamemode
Gamemode may refer to Creative mode, being used synonymously, ex. "I am in gamemode." Not to be confused with the space-separated term game mode, which is the playing state of the game (Creative, Survival, Adventure).
gear / geared
Armor; may refer to the removed block: Gear, however chances of seeing a player talk about it are extremely rare. Geared means "having armor equipped" and Gearing up means to equip armor. Can also mean tools, weapons and armor in general.

A technique used to locate bastion remnants or fortresses by setting the field of view setting to the minimum, focusing on a certain area, and then checking the entity count on the debug screen.

MLG

Ender pearl. Could be a verb as well (i.e. teleporting with an ender pearl). To "pearl away" (from something, someone, etc) is to flee a conflict, for example, an unwanted PvP battle, by throwing an ender pearl away from, for example, a fight.
perimeter

pick noun
A shortening for pickaxe.
pigman
This term is almost never used to describe Pigmen (the scrapped removed mob), and is seldom used as a short for piglins. Instead, it is used as a common short term for zombie pigmen. This term was used long before the Nether Update. Even after zombie pigmen have been renamed to zombified piglins, the term "Pigman" is still used for zombified piglins.
Pillager / Illager Base

  R
    raiding
While similar to the destructive form of griefing, the most notable difference is that raiding is done with the purpose of gaining material assets (i.e. items) or strategic advantages toward an enemy and in most cases, it is on a relatively large scale. This term is mostly used on Factions servers.

This is because the term "modded" for servers usually mean servers that do not accept vanilla clients at all, despite that semivanilla servers use modified server software, use third-party plugins, and/or run on systems like Bukkit and PaperMC. Semivanilla may simply mean "between modded and vanilla."

staff
Players that were granted additional commands to use compared to regular players, in order to help administrate the server. Staff members aren't necessarily Admins as they might not have even nearly full access to all of the commands, just like the real-life meaning of the term, where a staff member might not be on top of the hierarchy.
